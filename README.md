# Filament Theory Papers

A comprehensive collection of research papers introducing **Filament Theory** - a revolutionary unified framework for physics, mathematics, and cosmology.

## üåü Overview

Filament Theory proposes that reality consists of a fundamental medium of interacting "filaments" - the basic building blocks from which all matter, energy, space, and time emerge. This collection presents 16 peer-reviewed research papers that develop the theory from first principles to advanced applications.
